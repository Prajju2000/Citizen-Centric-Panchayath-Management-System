# E-Gram Panchayat Management System (EGPMS)

## Abstract

In rural areas, accessing panchayat services often involves traveling to the local panchayat office, which is time-consuming and prone to errors due to manual data entry. The E-Gram Panchayat Management System (EGPMS) addresses these issues by digitizing panchayat processes, providing a streamlined online platform for residents to access services, submit complaints, and view notifications. This system enhances efficiency, data security, and accessibility, allowing users to interact with their panchayat office anytime and from anywhere.

## Project Description

EGPMS is an online application designed to facilitate the management and monitoring of gram panchayat activities. The system offers the following features:

- **User Access:** Different levels of access are provided for administrators and panchayat body members. Only the admin can manage user access and maintain secure data.
- **Information Access:** Public users can search and view information about gram panchayat activities, government schemes, and other relevant notifications.
- **Online Applications:** Users can apply for certificates, submit complaints, and make suggestions online, eliminating the need for physical visits to the panchayat office.
- **Data Management:** Body members can update information and billing records, while only the admin has the authority to manage secure data and oversee system operations.
- **Transparency:** Users can view the distribution of funds collected through taxes and government allocations, providing transparency in financial management.
